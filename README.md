# Waggin-Ranch-Website

This is a full-stack website application that was developed by Owen Carpenter.

This application allows website users to view the Waggin' Ranch online store. Customers may look through the many services that this operation obtains. Also, a user is able to schedule upon requesting a service, and they are sent a confirmation later when finished. This application was used with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SendGrid's Email API for a fully functioning UI/UX.
